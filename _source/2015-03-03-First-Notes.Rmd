```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,cache=TRUE)

#knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, fig.path='myproject/plot-', cache=TRUE)

#library(rmarkdown)
#rmarkdown::render("test.Rmd", "html_document")
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## YAML
This is a header that goes at the top of an `.Rmd` file.

```` {r eval=FALSE}
title: "Post Name"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
author: "Your Name"
output:
    html_document:
      toc: true
      theme: cosmo
      keep_md: true
````

- `toc= true` tells R to include a table of contents.
- `theme: cosmo` Valid themes: "cerulean", "journal", "flatly", "readable", "spacelab", "united", and "cosmo".
- `date` uses R code to insert current date.

# Using Atom as your main editor

I wanted a nice, good looking, all purpose editor and have been using Sublime for a while. Things can be hard in Sublime however, and each time I need to set it up I run into difficulties. In comes Atom, thanks to Github.

> https://atom.io



config file which we made
 >"cmd-exec":
   commands: [
     {
       target: [
         "atom-workspace"
       ]
       data:
         "console:rscript":
           type: "spawn"
           useJSTemplateString: true
           path: "/usr/local/bin/Rscript -e library(rmarkdown);knitr::knit(commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)[1]) ${path.basename(CURRENT_FILE)}"
           console: true
     }
   ]

---------

## To do


* `cmd-exec` and making a custom command
    * `Rscript` command, run a very basic test to check your inputs
* Make `.r` file holding commands
    * save on github so it has permanent location, load from html(?)
    * eventually, make package?
* Run on save for .Rmd
    * open html if not open


__Explain__

What I am doing

* installed jekyll
  * type this into terminal `sudo gem install jekyll -n/usr/local/bin`
    * _Gems will be installed into `/usr/local/bin` and every user on your system can use them if it's in their PATH._
    * found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31972968/cant-install-gems-on-os-x-el-capitan)
    * Error from missing Gems ? install, i.e. to get gem called *jekyll-paginate*:
    `sudo gem install jekyll-paginate -n/usr/local/bin`

Very helpful blog post [Set up a Jekyll Blog in 5 Minutes ](http://www.sitepoint.com/set-jekyll-blog-5-minutes-poole/)

1. made a new directory called `ZoeDoesDataScience`, and navgated to this (`cd Zoe...`)
3. type this into iterm
```` bash
jekyll serve
````
4. in browser type <http://localhost:4000>
5. error!
  - Fix by:
  - `sudo gem install redcarpet`
  - open `_config.yml` file, add the line
  > gems: [jekyll-paginate]
  - comment out line `relative_permalinks: true`
  - REMOVE line with `gist` in the post (see error)
  - `sudo gem install pygments.rb`
  - **NOW IT WORKS** `jekyll serve` !!

### Important things

Key concepts  |  what is it
------------- | -----------------------------
github        | Think of this as a modern version of google drive, but which does way more
git           | github depends on git. It appears to be important, but mastery not necessary so far.



### Programs you want to have

Program       |  what is it
------------- | -------------
iTerm         | A nicer terminal than the default Mac terminal
brew          | A program which installs things for you
jekyll        | Engine to make nice looking blogs. Github uses Jekyll.
Atom          | An AWESOME editor. where you mainly work from.

To open __atom__ in current working dirctory: `atom .`

*  Atom packages I installed and how they work
  * R
  * Latex

* brew - sick of error messages due to missing dependencies. Go to http://brew.sh
  * To install it, paste the following into your editor:
```` bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
````
* diagram of how things relate
* diagram of file structure tree and Rmd, html files, templates etc
